### **FAQs for QuantumShield: A Readiness Analyzer for Post-Quantum Cryptography**

---

#### 1. **What is QuantumShield?**

**Answer:**  
QuantumShield is a tool designed to analyze the cryptographic readiness of systems against future quantum computing threats. It identifies cryptographic algorithms used in the code and assesses their vulnerability to quantum attacks, helping organizations transition to quantum-safe encryption algorithms. It provides a detailed report with vulnerability findings and remediation recommendations.

---

#### 2. **How does QuantumShield work?**

**Answer:**  
QuantumShield scans the provided code to identify cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA, AES, SHA) used in it. It then compares these algorithms against known quantum vulnerabilities based on quantum computing threats like Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The tool generates a report detailing vulnerabilities, their justification, and possible remediation steps using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

---

#### 3. **What are quantum vulnerabilities?**

**Answer:**  
Quantum vulnerabilities refer to the weaknesses in classical cryptographic algorithms that quantum computers can exploit. For example, quantum algorithms like Shor’s can break RSA encryption, and Grover’s algorithm can potentially reduce the security of symmetric encryption like AES. These vulnerabilities pose a significant risk in the future when quantum computing becomes mainstream.

---

#### 4. **What cryptographic algorithms does QuantumShield analyze?**

**Answer:**  
QuantumShield currently analyzes common cryptographic algorithms such as:
- **RSA**: Vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm.
- **AES**: Vulnerable to Grover’s algorithm.
- **SHA**: Vulnerable to quantum-based collision-finding algorithms.
The tool also provides remediation suggestions, such as using lattice-based cryptography or post-quantum safe algorithms.

---

#### 5. **How do I use QuantumShield?**

**Answer:**  
To use QuantumShield:
1. Upload a Python, Java, or C file that contains cryptographic algorithms.
2. The tool will analyze the file, identify any quantum-vulnerable algorithms, and generate a report.
3. You will receive a report with vulnerabilities, justifications, and recommended quantum-safe alternatives.

---

#### 6. **Can QuantumShield handle large codebases?**

**Answer:**  
Yes, QuantumShield can handle large codebases, but the analysis may take longer depending on the file size and complexity. For optimal performance, it’s recommended to analyze files one by one or in smaller batches.

---

#### 7. **What are the remediation suggestions provided by QuantumShield?**

**Answer:**  
For each quantum-vulnerable algorithm identified, QuantumShield provides suggestions to replace them with quantum-safe alternatives. Examples include:
- Replacing **RSA** with lattice-based cryptography algorithms like **NTRU** or post-quantum algorithms like **Kyber**.
- Replacing **AES** with quantum-safe encryption algorithms such as **Lizard** or **NTRUEncrypt**.
- Replacing **SHA-based hashing** with quantum-resistant algorithms such as hash-based signatures or lattice-based hashing.

---

#### 8. **What is the format of the generated report?**

**Answer:**  
The generated report is presented as a human-readable text with details about each finding, including:
- Algorithm used (e.g., RSA, AES, SHA)
- File name and code snippet where the algorithm is used
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID related to the vulnerability
- Description of the vulnerability
- Justification for why it's a vulnerability in the context of quantum computing
- Suggested remediation with post-quantum cryptographic alternatives

---

#### 9. **Do I need any special hardware to run QuantumShield?**

**Answer:**  
No, you don’t need any special hardware to run QuantumShield. It works on standard machines with Python installed. You only need a Python environment and required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`) to run the tool.

---

#### 10. **What if my code uses a custom cryptographic algorithm?**

**Answer:**  
Currently, QuantumShield analyzes well-known cryptographic algorithms like RSA, AES, and SHA. If your code uses a custom cryptographic algorithm, the tool might not be able to identify it unless it's mapped to known algorithms. However, you can extend the tool’s capabilities by adding custom checks for your own algorithms.

---

#### 11. **Why should I care about post-quantum cryptography?**

**Answer:**  
Quantum computing is a powerful technology that could break many of the cryptographic systems currently in use, including RSA, ECC, and some symmetric encryption methods. Transitioning to post-quantum cryptography ensures that your data and communications remain secure even in the era of quantum computing. Post-quantum cryptography algorithms are designed to resist quantum-based attacks, making them more future-proof.

---

#### 12. **Is this tool free to use?**

**Answer:**  
Yes, QuantumShield is an open-source tool, and you can use it free of charge. However, contributions, bug reports, or feature requests are welcome to improve the tool over time.
